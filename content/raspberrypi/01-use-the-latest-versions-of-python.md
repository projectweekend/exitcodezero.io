The Raspberry Pi's [Raspbian operating system](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) uses default versions of Python that are out of date. Using the open source [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) tool you can easily install and manage the latest versions. I use it, almost daily, for development projects at work and home. Having worked in Python both with and without `pyenv`, I can confidently say using it makes life much better.


### Install and update pyenv
Using the official [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer) you can get started with `pyenv` in just a few steps. First, download the install script and execute it in bash.

```bash
$ curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash
```

At the end of the installer's output, you will see a warning message telling you to add some configuration to the `~/.bash_profile` file. On the Raspberry Pi, you will add this to the end of the `~/.bashrc` file instead.

Finally, log out and back in before issuing the command to update `pyenv`.

```bash
$ pyenv update
```

At this point, you are ready to use `pyenv` to install new versions of Python.


### Install the latest Python versions
Use the `install` command to download and install any version of Python. At the time of this writing, the latest release for Python 2 was 2.7.13. The following command installs that version.

```bash
$ pyenv install 2.7.13
```

Don't be alarmed if the install process takes a while to complete; this is normal. Once it finishes, repeat the command above using the latest release of Python 3.

```bash
$ pyenv install 3.6.2
```

With both versions of Python installed, you can use `pyenv` to switch between them as needed.


### Switch between Python versions
Use the `versions` command to see all versions of Python installed on the Raspberry Pi, including the system default.

```bash
$ pyenv versions
```

You can switch Python versions locally at the directory level. If you have a Python 3 project at the path `~/whatever`, use the `local` command inside that path to set the version. After doing so, any Python code executed in this location will use the specified version instead of the system default.

```bash
$ cd ~/whatever
~/whatever $ pyenv local 3.6.2
```

To change Python versions globally, across the entire system, use the `global` command.

```bash
$ pyenv global 3.6.2
```

### Wrap up
Having the ability to use different versions of Python, per project, without disturbing the default system installation is quite powerful. It gives you the freedom to experiment while not breaking things. In the next chapter, we will build on this concept and learn about using separate virtual Python environments for every project.
