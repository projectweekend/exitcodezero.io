# A Different Kind of Raspberry Pi Guide

There are plenty of great tutorials on how to do just about everything with the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/about/) these days. So, why am I writing this? Well, the best I can say is, this information is kind of different.

I've worked in tech for a little over decade now, both as a software engineer and a consultant. I've also been tinkering with the Pi for as long as it's been commercially available. On every new project I'd find ways to incorporate some of the tools and tactics I had picked up professionally.

Not all of these cross-over experiments were successful, but I had fun doing them. The ones that did pan out, however, made my time spent with the Raspberry Pi more consistent and enjoyable. With that said, I'd like to share the tips and tricks I've found to be most useful over the last few years.
